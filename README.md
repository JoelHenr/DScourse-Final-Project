# DScourse-Final-Project


This is a study of whether the notion of "Home Advantage" actually exists in sports. 

In order to replication this study, simply go to the file named "FP_Henriques.R". Open this file and press source code. It will automatically run the fixed effects, robust standard errors, probit, and logit models. The code has specific titles that correspond the code with the tables and figures used in the paper. All marginal effects are located as "tables" in the paper and in the code. All of the fixed effects are labeled "figures" in the paper and in the code as well in order to help differentiate these visuals.
